## Application Workflow

### Step 1: Data Upload
1. **File Upload Interface**: Users upload CSV files containing swimmer personal bests
2. **Data Validation**: System validates CSV format and swimmer information
3. **County Times Import**: Reference standards are loaded for qualification checking
4. **Data Processing**: Swimmer times are converted to seconds and stored with metadata

**Code Flow:**
```typescript
// Client uploads CSV file via FileUploadSection component
const handleFileUpload = async (file: File) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);
  
  // POST /api/upload-swimmers processes the CSV
  await apiRequest('POST', '/api/upload-swimmers', formData);
}
```

**Server Processing:**
```typescript
// routes.ts - processes uploaded CSV
app.post("/api/upload-swimmers", upload.single('file'), async (req, res) => {
  // Parse CSV, validate swimmer data
  // Convert times to seconds for optimization
  // Store in database with availability flags
});
```

### Step 2: Squad Selection
1. **Swimmer Display**: All uploaded swimmers shown with availability status
2. **Filtering System**: Search by name, filter by gender/age categories
3. **Availability Toggle**: Mark swimmers as available/unavailable for selection
4. **Bulk Operations**: Select all available swimmers with one click

**Code Flow:**
```typescript
// SquadSelectionSection manages swimmer availability
const updateAvailability = useMutation({
  mutationFn: ({ id, isAvailable }) => 
    apiRequest('PATCH', `/api/swimmers/${id}`, { isAvailable }),
  onSuccess: () => refetchSwimmers()
});
```

**Database Update:**
```typescript
// Updates swimmer availability in real-time
await storage.updateSwimmer(id, { isAvailable });
```

### Step 3: Event Assignment
1. **Event Configuration**: Display all available events with age/gender categories
2. **Pre-Assignment Interface**: Manually assign key swimmers to specific events
3. **Relay Setup**: Configure relay teams with position-specific assignments
4. **Optimization Trigger**: Run Python algorithm to optimize remaining assignments

**Code Flow:**
```typescript
// EventAssignmentSection handles pre-assignments and optimization
const handleRunOptimization = async () => {
  // Save pre-assignments to database  
  await savePreAssignments(eventAssignments, relayAssignments);
  
  // Trigger Python optimization script
  const results = await apiRequest('POST', '/api/optimize');
  onOptimizationComplete(results);
};
```

**Python Integration:**
```python
# optimizer.py - Advanced team selection algorithm
def main():
    # Load swimmer data from CSV
    # Load county qualifying times
    # Process pre-assignments from JSON
    
    # Run optimization algorithm:
    # 1. Honor pre-assignments (protected events)
    # 2. Optimize remaining events for best team performance
    # 3. Consider swimmer availability and event limits
    # 4. Generate relay team combinations
    
    # Return optimized assignments as JSON
```

### Step 4: Results Display
1. **Individual Events**: Show optimized swimmer assignments with times
2. **Relay Teams**: Display relay compositions with predicted performance
3. **Statistics Summary**: Team performance metrics and qualifying counts
4. **Export Options**: Download results for meet management systems

**Code Flow:**
```typescript
// ResultsSection displays optimization results
const { individual, relay, stats } = optimizationResults;

// Render individual event assignments
individual.map(assignment => (
  <div key={assignment.event}>
    {assignment.swimmer} - {assignment.time}
  </div>
));
```

## Core Algorithm Logic

The Python optimization engine implements sophisticated team selection:

### 1. Data Preparation
- Convert all times to seconds for numerical comparison
- Load county qualifying standards by age/gender/course
- Parse pre-assignments and mark as protected events

### 2. Constraint Management  
- Respect swimmer availability flags
- Honor pre-assigned events (cannot be overwritten)
- Limit swimmers to maximum events per competition
- Ensure age/gender eligibility for all assignments

### 3. Optimization Strategy
- **Individual Events**: Assign fastest available swimmer per event
- **Relay Teams**: Generate all possible combinations and select fastest
- **Performance Scoring**: Calculate team index based on county time standards
- **Qualification Tracking**: Count swimmers meeting county standards

### 4. Result Generation
- Format assignments with swimmer details and predicted times  
- Calculate team statistics and performance metrics
- Export data in format compatible with frontend display

## Database Schema

```sql
-- Core swimmer information
swimmers: id, firstName, lastName, asaNo, dateOfBirth, gender, age, isAvailable

-- Personal best times for each swimmer
swimmer_times: id, swimmerId, event, course, time, timeInSeconds, meet, date

-- County qualifying standards
county_times: id, event, time, ageCategory, course, timeType, gender

-- Pre-assigned individual events  
event_assignments: id, event, ageCategory, gender, swimmerId, isPreAssigned

-- Pre-assigned relay positions
relay_assignments: id, relayName, ageCategory, gender, position, stroke, swimmerId

-- Optimization results storage
optimization_results: id, sessionId, resultType, event, swimmers, totalTime
```

## Installation & Setup

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimization Speed**: Python algorithm processes 100+ swimmers in under 10 seconds
- **Memory Efficiency**: In-memory storage suitable for teams up to 500 swimmers  
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for live optimization progress
- **Export Performance**: CSV generation optimized for large datasets

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Amend the csv file so it can be imported as either csv or xlsx
- [ ] Amend the format so it can be downloaded straight from swim manager and uploaded
- [ ] Include more selection on the first page including: session template (arena league, county relays?, custom? (so user selects all the events and age groups + relays)
- [ ] Convert into a mobile app
- [ ] Integration with swim rankings api
