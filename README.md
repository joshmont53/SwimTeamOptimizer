# Swimming Team Optimizer

A comprehensive web-based application designed to optimize swimming team selection for galas and competitions. This system uses advanced algorithms to assign swimmers to events based on their personal best times, county qualifying standards, and strategic team optimization.

## Features

### 🏊‍♂️ Core Functionality

- **Automated workflows** for server management

## Application Workflow

### Step 1: Data Upload
1. **File Upload Interface**: Users upload CSV files containing swimmer personal bests
2. **Data Validation**: System validates CSV format and swimmer information
3. **County Times Import**: Reference standards are loaded for qualification checking
4. **Data Processing**: Swimmer times are converted to seconds and stored with metadata

**Code Flow:**
```typescript
// Client uploads CSV file via FileUploadSection component
const handleFileUpload = async (file: File) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);
  
  // POST /api/upload-swimmers processes the CSV
  await apiRequest('POST', '/api/upload-swimmers', formData);
}
```

**Server Processing:**
```typescript
// routes.ts - processes uploaded CSV
app.post("/api/upload-swimmers", upload.single('file'), async (req, res) => {
  // Parse CSV, validate swimmer data
  // Convert times to seconds for optimization
  // Store in database with availability flags
});
```

### Step 2: Squad Selection
1. **Swimmer Display**: All uploaded swimmers shown with availability status
2. **Filtering System**: Search by name, filter by gender/age categories
3. **Availability Toggle**: Mark swimmers as available/unavailable for selection
4. **Bulk Operations**: Select all available swimmers with one click

**Code Flow:**
```typescript
// SquadSelectionSection manages swimmer availability
const updateAvailability = useMutation({
  mutationFn: ({ id, isAvailable }) => 
    apiRequest('PATCH', `/api/swimmers/${id}`, { isAvailable }),
  onSuccess: () => refetchSwimmers()
});
```

**Database Update:**
```typescript
// Updates swimmer availability in real-time
await storage.updateSwimmer(id, { isAvailable });
```

### Step 3: Event Assignment
1. **Event Configuration**: Display all available events with age/gender categories
2. **Pre-Assignment Interface**: Manually assign key swimmers to specific events
3. **Relay Setup**: Configure relay teams with position-specific assignments
4. **Optimization Trigger**: Run Python algorithm to optimize remaining assignments

**Code Flow:**
```typescript
// EventAssignmentSection handles pre-assignments and optimization
const handleRunOptimization = async () => {
  // Save pre-assignments to database  
  await savePreAssignments(eventAssignments, relayAssignments);
  
  // Trigger Python optimization script
  const results = await apiRequest('POST', '/api/optimize');
  onOptimizationComplete(results);
};
```

**Python Integration:**
```python
# optimizer.py - Advanced team selection algorithm
def main():
    # Load swimmer data from CSV
    # Load county qualifying times
    # Process pre-assignments from JSON
    
    # Run optimization algorithm:
    # 1. Honor pre-assignments (protected events)
    # 2. Optimize remaining events for best team performance
    # 3. Consider swimmer availability and event limits
    # 4. Generate relay team combinations
    
    # Return optimized assignments as JSON
```

### Step 4: Results Display
1. **Individual Events**: Show optimized swimmer assignments with times
2. **Relay Teams**: Display relay compositions with predicted performance
3. **Statistics Summary**: Team performance metrics and qualifying counts
4. **Export Options**: Download results for meet management systems

**Code Flow:**
```typescript
// ResultsSection displays optimization results
const { individual, relay, stats } = optimizationResults;

// Render individual event assignments
individual.map(assignment => (
  <div key={assignment.event}>
    {assignment.swimmer} - {assignment.time}
  </div>
));
```

## Core Algorithm Logic

The Python optimization engine implements sophisticated team selection:

### 1. Data Preparation
- Convert all times to seconds for numerical comparison
- Load county qualifying standards by age/gender/course
- Parse pre-assignments and mark as protected events

### 2. Constraint Management  
- Respect swimmer availability flags
- Honor pre-assigned events (cannot be overwritten)
- Limit swimmers to maximum events per competition
- Ensure age/gender eligibility for all assignments

### 3. Optimization Strategy
- **Individual Events**: Assign fastest available swimmer per event
- **Relay Teams**: Generate all possible combinations and select fastest
- **Performance Scoring**: Calculate team index based on county time standards
- **Qualification Tracking**: Count swimmers meeting county standards

### 4. Result Generation
- Format assignments with swimmer details and predicted times  
- Calculate team statistics and performance metrics
- Export data in format compatible with frontend display

## Database Schema

```sql
-- Core swimmer information
swimmers: id, firstName, lastName, asaNo, dateOfBirth, gender, age, isAvailable

-- Personal best times for each swimmer
swimmer_times: id, swimmerId, event, course, time, timeInSeconds, meet, date

-- County qualifying standards
county_times: id, event, time, ageCategory, course, timeType, gender

-- Pre-assigned individual events  
event_assignments: id, event, ageCategory, gender, swimmerId, isPreAssigned

-- Pre-assigned relay positions
relay_assignments: id, relayName, ageCategory, gender, position, stroke, swimmerId

-- Optimization results storage
optimization_results: id, sessionId, resultType, event, swimmers, totalTime
```

- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for live optimization progress
- **Export Performance**: CSV generation optimized for large datasets

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Amend the csv file so it can be imported as either csv or xlsx
- [ ] Amend the format so it can be downloaded straight from swim manager and uploaded
- [ ] Include more selection on the first page including: session template (arena league, county relays?, custom? (so user selects all the events and age groups + relays)
- [ ] Convert into a mobile app
- [ ] Integration with swim rankings api
