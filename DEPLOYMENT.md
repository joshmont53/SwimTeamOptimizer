## Deployment Steps

### 1. Replit Deployment
The application is optimized for Replit deployment with:
- Automatic workflow management
- PostgreSQL integration configured
- Python environment properly set up
- Hot reload development environment
- Production-ready configuration

### 2. Environment Setup
Required environment variables (automatically configured in Replit):
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to 'production' for deployment
- Python 3.8+ runtime available

### 3. Database Migration
The application will automatically:
- Create necessary database tables on first run
- Handle schema migrations via Drizzle ORM
- Initialize with proper indexes and constraints

### 4. Production Monitoring
Key metrics to monitor:
- Optimization algorithm execution time (<10 seconds for 100+ swimmers)
- Database query performance
- CSV upload processing speed
- Memory usage during large dataset processing

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Test the Core Workflow
1. **Team Creation**: Create a new team with Arena League template
2. **Data Upload**: Upload sample CSV files (member_pbs_sample.csv and county_times_sample.csv)
3. **Squad Selection**: Verify swimmer availability toggling
4. **Event Assignment**: Test individual and relay pre-assignments
5. **Optimization**: Run optimization and verify results
6. **Results Display**: Check individual and relay assignments display correctly

### Verify Relay Pre-Assignments
1. Create relay assignments with specific positions
2. Create medley relay assignments with specific strokes
3. Run optimization
4. Verify pre-assignments persist and appear in results
5. Confirm database retains assignments after optimization

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance
- **Optimization Time**: <10 seconds for teams with 100+ swimmers
- **CSV Upload**: <5 seconds for typical CSV files (1000+ records)
- **Database Operations**: <1 second for standard queries
- **Memory Usage**: <512MB for typical workloads

### Optimization Improvements Achieved
- **Medley Relay Performance**: 4+ second improvements through proper stroke selection
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Enhanced with pre-assignment validation
- **Database Operations**: Selective clearing preserves pre-assignments

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All swimmer data stored securely in PostgreSQL
- CSV files processed and cleaned after upload
- No sensitive data exposed in API responses
- Proper input validation on all endpoints

### Access Control
- Team-based data isolation
- No cross-team data access
- Secure file upload handling
- SQL injection protection via ORM

## Support and Maintenance

### Monitoring Points
1. **Algorithm Performance**: Monitor optimization execution times
2. **Database Growth**: Track database size as teams are added
3. **Error Rates**: Monitor Python script execution success
4. **User Feedback**: Track any reported optimization accuracy issues

### Common Issues and Solutions
1. **CSV Upload Errors**: Check file format and encoding
2. **Optimization Failures**: Verify swimmer availability settings
3. **Relay Assignment Issues**: Confirm swimmer eligibility for events
4. **Performance Degradation**: Monitor database query performance

## Backup and Recovery

### Data Backup
- PostgreSQL automated backups via Replit
- Critical data: teams, swimmers, personal bests, optimization results
- Recovery time objective: <1 hour
- Recovery point objective: <24 hours

### Disaster Recovery
- Application code stored in GitHub repository
- Database schema recreatable via Drizzle migrations
- Sample data available for testing recovery procedures

## GitHub Repository Sync

### Updated Documentation
- [x] README.md updated with latest features
- [x] CHANGELOG.md created with comprehensive release notes
- [x] API documentation current
- [x] Technical architecture documented in replit.md

### Code Quality
