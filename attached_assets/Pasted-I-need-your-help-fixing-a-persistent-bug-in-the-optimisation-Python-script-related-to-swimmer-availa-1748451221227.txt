I need your help fixing a persistent bug in the optimisation Python script related to swimmer availability, without undoing any of the recent fixes made regarding predetermined event selections.

üêõ Bug Summary:
Even when a swimmer is marked as unavailable on the swimmer selection page, they are still appearing in:

The event preselection dropdowns

The final optimiser‚Äôs output

The optimisation logic and results

This should not happen.

‚öôÔ∏è Important Technical Context:
The Python script receives a list of swimmers, generated from the uploaded CSV and frontend inputs

There is existing code in the Python script intended to filter out unavailable swimmers

However, this logic is not working as intended

Additionally, the app recently introduced a fix so that predetermined (preselected) swimmers for specific events are always respected and never overwritten ‚Äî this working fix must remain untouched

‚úÖ Expected Outcome:
Unavailable swimmers (as selected on the front end) must be fully excluded from:

The data sent to the optimiser

The list of valid swimmers for each event

The optimiser‚Äôs assignment logic

The final results output

Predetermined swimmer-event assignments must still take priority and never be overwritten, even if that swimmer is not optimal

üìã What You Need to Do:
Trace the flow of swimmer data:

Identify where swimmer availability is passed from the front end to the backend/Python script

Confirm the format and location of availability flags (e.g. is it a column in the CSV? JSON metadata?)

Inspect the Python script:

Locate the part where the CSV data is converted into a list of lists

Review the existing filtering logic that attempts to exclude unavailable swimmers

Debug and correct the filtering logic, ensuring that only available swimmers are passed to the optimiser

Preserve logic that handles preselection of swimmers for events ‚Äî do not remove, override, or undo any of the fixes already implemented in this area

üß™ Testing Requirements:
Perform and evidence the following test:

Upload a CSV with multiple swimmers

On the swimmer selection screen, deselect 1 or more swimmers

Proceed through to event assignment and run the optimiser

Confirm:

The deselected swimmers do not appear in any dropdowns

The optimiser never selects them in the results

The final output respects swimmer availability and predetermined swimmer-event assignments

Show visible proof ‚Äî log prints, screenshots, or include a FixVerification.md file showing what changed and that both logics now work together.

Let me know if anything blocks you.
