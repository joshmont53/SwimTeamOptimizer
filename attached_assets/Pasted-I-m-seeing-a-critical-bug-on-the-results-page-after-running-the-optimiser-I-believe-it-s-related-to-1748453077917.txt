I'm seeing a critical bug on the results page after running the optimiser. I believe it's related to the logic used to filter out unavailable swimmers. Let me explain:

‚ùó Problem:
On the final results page, totals like Average Index, Total Events Assigned, etc. all show 0 or NaN.

Here's the HTML element for one of the broken figures:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700">NaN</div>
<div class="text-sm text-blue-600">Average Index</div>
The debug_output.txt doesn't get generated anymore, and optimisation results are empty.

On the frontend (step 3), the dropdown for swimmers correctly excludes unavailable swimmers ‚Äî that part works.

üîç Likely Cause:
It seems that the backend is returning an empty or malformed results object because the logic that filters swimmers (likely in optimizer.py or data_loader.py) is either:

Excluding all swimmers, not just those marked unavailable

Not matching the format required for downstream result calculations

Breaking the JSON structure expected by the results page

‚úÖ What I need:
Please do the following carefully:

Inspect the backend code ‚Äî especially around where the CSV is imported, swimmers are filtered by availability, and the results dictionary is generated.

Confirm the structure of the final data returned to the frontend. It must include correct values to populate the results page metrics (average index, event count, etc).

Ensure that only unavailable swimmers are excluded ‚Äî do not exclude everyone.

Preserve all functionality around predetermined swimmer assignments to events.

Fix any logic that causes NaN or 0 values in the results page. Check that the frontend is receiving real, meaningful numbers.

Run a test yourself to confirm that:

Available swimmers are assigned to events

Predetermined swimmer/event combos are respected

All key figures (like Average Index) appear correctly

No internal server error occurs

Once this is verified, send me the updated debug_output.txt or console log showing:

Number of swimmers included

Their names and availability status

Any event assignments made
